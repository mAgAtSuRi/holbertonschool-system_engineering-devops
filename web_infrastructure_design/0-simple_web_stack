What happens:

User types www.foobar.com.

DNS resolves www.foobar.com → 8.8.8.8.

Browser sends HTTP/HTTPS request to the server.

Nginx handles HTTP requests:

Serves static files.

Sends dynamic requests to the application server.

Application server executes code and queries MySQL if needed.

MySQL responds; app server formats response.

Nginx sends HTML/JSON back to the user.


Limitations: single point of failure (SPOF), downtime during maintenance, cannot scale.
