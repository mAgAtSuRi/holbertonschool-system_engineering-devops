What happens:

User request hits either LB (cluster for high availability).

LB forwards to any web server.

Web server handles HTTP requests, passes dynamic requests to application servers.

Application servers execute code and interact with:

DB Primary (writes)

DB Replica (reads)

Response is sent back through the web server → load balancer → user.

Key points:

Each layer is isolated:

Web servers → scale horizontally

App servers → scale independently

DB servers → separate, can replicate

Load balancer cluster removes SPOF at entry point.

Easier maintenance, better security, better scaling.

Still need HA for DB writes, monitoring, SSL end-to-end.
