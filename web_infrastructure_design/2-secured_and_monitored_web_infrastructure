What happens:

User accesses https://www.foobar.com.

Firewall filters allowed traffic (443).

Load balancer decrypts HTTPS (SSL termination) and distributes requests to web servers.

Web servers pass requests to app servers.

App servers interact with DB Primary for writes and DB Replica for reads.

Monitoring agents collect metrics and logs, send them to centralized monitoring tool.

Key points:

Traffic is encrypted for the user.

Firewalls protect servers.

Monitoring tracks server health, performance, and QPS.

Issues:

SSL termination at LB means internal traffic is unencrypted.

DB Primary is still a SPOF.

Servers still run multiple components together → harder to scale or maintain.
