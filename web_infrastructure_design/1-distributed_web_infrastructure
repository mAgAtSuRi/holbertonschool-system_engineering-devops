What happens:

User requests www.foobar.com.

DNS points to Load Balancer.

Load Balancer distributes traffic using round-robin:

Request 1 → Server 1

Request 2 → Server 2

Each server has a complete stack:

Nginx handles HTTP.

App server executes code.

MySQL responds (Server 1 = Primary for writes, Server 2 = Replica for reads).

Responses sent back to user via load balancer.

Key points:

Reduces load on a single server.

Still SPOF on DB Primary and Load Balancer.

Active–Active LB: both servers handle traffic.

Replica DB handles reads only.
